Hello, everyone! My name is Nathaniel Barton, and here are some skills that may be pertinent to the group project later this semester:

* I have previous experience with managing a group repository. A few semesters ago, I was director of a Lab Demo, which is a proof-of-concept
  for a potential full-production video game (almost like what a pilot episode is to a TV show). We used GitHub as our source control, though
  this took some trial-and-error to perfect, as we had to use a few third-party tools to handle the large files of the Unreal Engine 
  development environment (namely, GitLFS). Though this project was very much a team effort, I was primarily responsible for researching 
  source control solutions.

* I am perhaps more well-adapted to efficient, on-the-fly problem-solving than most, as I routinely do it on behalf of others as a CSCI tutor
  in ETSU's Center for Academic Achievement. If we encounter any snags in the course of development, I am a good pick to find solutions 
  and/or workarounds.

* I am currently becoming more familiar with the lower-level workings of computers, as I am intermittently (but steadily) teaching myself
  C. Though the language itself may not end up being useful, it is quickly granting me a more robust understanding of low-level computer 
  operations, particularly memory management.
